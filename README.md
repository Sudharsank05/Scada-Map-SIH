# SCADA_Map 
SCADA system topology mapping project using EIGRP routing protocol


## Description
This project focuses on **automatically discovering network topology** for SCADA systems using the **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**. The goal is to build a tool that maps the network topology in real-time, without using CDP/LLDP protocols, and leveraging syslog for anomaly detection and device identification.

### Features
- Network Topology Discovery**: Identifies and visualizes the network topology in SCADA systems.
- Security: Uses SNMPv3 and other secure protocols for communication and data collection.
- Anomaly Detection**: Real-time monitoring to detect any irregularities or threats in the SCADA network.
- EIGRP Integration**: Maps the network topology using the EIGRP routing protocol.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/scada_map.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd scada_map
Install any dependencies (if applicable). For example, if using Python:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up and configure your SCADA network for discovery.

Usage
Run the topology discovery script (example for Python):

bash
Copy code
python discover_topology.py
Visualize the network map through the output (can be in a web interface or terminal-based depending on your tool design).

Configure SNMP, NetFlow, ARP/MAC tables, or syslog as per the project requirements.
